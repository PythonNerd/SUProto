SU Game Prototype
-- INITS
----Load enemies, items, characters, locations, perks
-- ENGINE
----Calculates actions, rng, variables. Handles user inputs.
-- GAME
----Running the actual game. You create your character, 
----assign 10 points to skills, then choose a location to delve into.
----Each location will have a random number of areas to clear and enemies in them.
----Locations will have difficulty and this will be used to spawn harder enemies.
----After clearing an area you return to the hub with your new loot.
-- SAVE
----Character info is backed up so next time you play you have your data.

Add a story / campaign mode.

Described above. This is where you will go after adventures. 
Each call to hub backs up character data too.

Going to a location calls loadLocation(location) in gameengine, which then
builds that location.

Going to equipment brings up a menu that shows what you have equipped, along
with a list of your inventory. Pick a part and swap it out to see your stats
change too.

Going to the shop lets you sell loot or buy new items.

Going to the library will let you browse books that have pages you read. 
Library will be stored in another file for now.
